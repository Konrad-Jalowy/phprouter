# phprouter 

## how to start server
ok well use such command to start a server:
``sh
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```

## Before creation:
Ive already done huge mvc framework project that was basically 3 other (not mine) projects combined + my own ideas </br>
Still it was long time ago and i want to re-visit the concept. </br>
Here ill do simple router (without even middleware i guess) </br>
There will be some mini-project like that and then ill think how to connect things so that i have a framework in a form i think is the best </br>
And most of all - i understand everything and it was no-brainer for me </br>
I guess ill need to implement:
- Session
- Router class
- Some helper functions
- Some autoloading feature
- Controller to show off it works
- htaccess 

## After doing:
Ill update this one once im done with the router.
