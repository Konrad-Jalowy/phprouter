# phprouter 

## how to start server
ok well use such command to start a server:
```sh
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```
Its because i have this project in xampp. so there would be difference between folder structure and the uri</br>
Like url from routes is "/" and the url in project is "localhost/projectfolder/". </br>

## EDIT: Some background:
Some time ago i did 3 projects (not mine) on making PHP MVC framework. Then i used those projects and my own ideas to create my own MVC PHP framework project </br>
Then i focused more on other things including other programming languages and using frameworks rather than writing my own </br>
Now im re-visiting the concept and start with simple router for framework </br>
This router needs to be better i need middleware support and some more cleaver and readable way for route method </br>
I also need some type of db connection, session and cookies support, do it in composer project with proper autoloading, templating engine and so on </br>
I did it all in my old project but it was some time since i coded OOP pure-php code and i need some warmup before i start re-creating it and improving </br>
It was challenging project i barely got working and barely understood back then. Since then i havent coded much in pure-php oop. So i need some warmup </br>
I do it totally in my free time, when i dont focus on languages i learn/use mostly right now. But there will be more project with the aim to make great php-written mvc framework. </br>
## Thoughts (TODO next project):
- In next iteration there will be middleware
- In next iteration session will be solved using middleware
## Before creation (old readmemd):
Ive already done huge mvc framework project that was basically 3 other (not mine) projects combined + my own ideas </br>
Still it was long time ago and i want to re-visit the concept. </br>
Here ill do simple router (without even middleware i guess) </br>
There will be some mini-project like that and then ill think how to connect things so that i have a framework in a form i think is the best </br>
And most of all - i understand everything and it was no-brainer for me </br>
I guess ill need to implement:
- Session
- Router class
- Some helper functions
- Some autoloading feature
- Controller to show off it works
- htaccess
